# AltPlugin-Fixes
My fixes for AltPlugin in an easily stored area.
Check the releases tab for the zip files.

Download the script `altplugindownloader.sh` and then run the following in a terminal in the same directory as the script:
```bash
chmod +x altplugindownloader.sh
sudo ./altplugindownloader.sh
```
After the script has ran, then open your Mail app, go to Preferences > General, at the bottom "Manage Plug-Ins", click that, enable AltPlugin, and restart Mail. Voila!
